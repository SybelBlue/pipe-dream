This is a tool for learning how to visualize and work with certain functional programming staples, specifically those common in the Java 8 Stream API.

Users construct a pipeline out of machines like `map`, `filter`, `take`, and `count`, each level consisting of one challenge and some set of usable machines.

This was created by Logan Caraco for a Macalester Independent Study in CS.
